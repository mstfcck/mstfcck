Hi üëã It is Mustafa √ái√ßek!

SOFTWARE DEVELOPER / CONSULTANT / LEAD / SENIOR / FULL-STACK...
------------------

As a software developer, I have over ten years of expertise (since 2011).

During my career, I've had the opportunity to work for various companies, projects, and teams, allowing me to be a part of many of them from the start and work with the most cutting-edge technologies of the time.

Although the Back-End, Web, and the .NET Platform are my primary areas of experience, I have also worked with a wide range of technologies, frameworks, libraries, tools, and third-party apps.

Besides that, I have additional experience as a Full-Stack Developer in Java, Java Spring Boot, JavaScript, NodeJS, Windows Services, Front-End, React, Angular, Cloud, IoT, and related frameworks, libraries, etc.

Even though I have skills that have become rusty over time, I continue to closely follow and learn about the most cutting-edge technologies, languages, and architectures.

As a real team player and a fast-adapting person, I trust my abilities and never hesitate to assume responsibility.
